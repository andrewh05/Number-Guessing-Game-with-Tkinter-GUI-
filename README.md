A fun and interactive Python game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range, built using the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The game offers a user-friendly experience with real-time feedback displayed on the interface, helping the player determine whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Features:

Graphical User Interface: Built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and visually appealing layout.
Random Number Generation: The computer selects a random number within a customizable range (default: 1-100).
Real-Time Feedback: The game updates the player after each guess, indicating if the number is too high, too low, or correct.
Attempt Tracker: The game counts and displays the number of attempts the player has made.
Customizable Range: Option to adjust the range of numbers for increased difficulty.
How to Play:

Run the script.
Input your guess in the provided field within the Tkinter window.
Click the "Guess" button.
Receive feedback in the GUI:
"Too low!" if the guess is less than the target number.
"Too high!" if the guess is greater than the target number.
"Congratulations!" if you guessed the number correctly.
The game will continue until the correct number is guessed.
